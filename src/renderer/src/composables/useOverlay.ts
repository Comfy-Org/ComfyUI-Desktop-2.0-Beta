/**
 * Overlay slot foundation.
 *
 * Each panel host (`PanelApp` and `ChooserView`) owns exactly ONE
 * `currentOverlay` slot — one DOM node mounted at a time. Opening a
 * new overlay replaces whatever is currently in the slot, subject to
 * the tier-collision rules below.
 *
 * The kinds form a discriminated union:
 *   - `settings`  — Unified Settings modal (ComfyUI Settings tab via
 *                   embedded DetailModal, Directories tab, Global
 *                   Settings tab). Tier 1.
 *   - `progress` — ProgressModal for a long-running action that does
 *                  NOT end in the running ComfyUI app (delete,
 *                  snapshot, copy, update-while-stopped). Tier 2.
 *   - `takeover` — Full-window takeover for actions that end in the
 *                  app (launch, install, update-then-restart,
 *                  first-use). Tier 3.
 *
 * App-update is NOT an overlay kind — the title-bar pill click pops a
 * `useModal.confirm` modal rendered by the global `<ModalDialog />`
 * mount, not by this slot.
 *
 * Tier 3 (`kind: 'takeover'`) owns first-use, the four install-flow
 * wizards (NewInstall / Track / LoadSnapshot / QuickInstall), and
 * update-while-running, all of which need the binding-modal chrome
 * the tier provides.
 *
 * Tier-collision rules — implemented by `openOverlay`:
 *   - Tier 1 → any tier: auto-replace silently.
 *   - Tier 2 → Tier 1: silently kill the lower-tier overlay (Tier 1
 *             would normally replace silently anyway, but a Tier 2 op
 *             on top doesn't "drop" to Tier 1 — the Tier 2 wins).
 *   - Tier 2 → Tier 2 (replace while running): prompt to cancel the
 *             current op via the standardised cancel-prompt copy.
 *   - Tier 3 → Tier 1: pre-empts silently.
 *   - Tier 3 → Tier 2: pre-empts with the same cancel prompt.
 *   - Anything → Tier 3 already mounted: pre-empts silently
 *             (takeover replacing takeover is rare — used by the
 *             multi-step first-use flow chaining into new-install).
 *
 * The standardised cancel-prompt copy is sourced from
 * `overlay.cancelCurrentTitle` / `overlay.cancelNamedTitle` so every
 * caller speaks with one voice ("Cancel current operation?" /
 * `Cancel "Updating ComfyUI"?`).

/**
 * Unified Settings modal — ModalShell with a left-rail tab switcher
 * hosting "ComfyUI Settings" (per-install DetailModal body),
 * "Directories" (combined Models / Media browser), and "Global
 * Settings" (launcher-wide settings). Every install-pill / waffle /
 * chooser-card-Manage entry-point routes through here.
 *
 * `installation` is null on install-less host windows opening the
 * modal from the file-menu Settings entry — the "ComfyUI Settings"
 * tab is hidden and the default falls through to "Global Settings".
 *
 * `initialDetailTab` and `autoAction` are forwarded to the embedded
 * DetailModal so chooser-card update / migrate pills can deep-link
 * straight to the Update tab with the relevant action pre-armed.
 *
 * `noSidebar` collapses the modal to just the active tab's content
 * (no left rail, no tab switcher). Used for chooser-card "Manage…" /
 * Update / Migrate entry-points where the user picked a specific
 * install and wants the focused per-install Settings surface — the
 * sidebar's Directories / Global Settings tabs would be a distraction
 * in that flow. The file-menu / title-bar Settings entry leaves it
 * unset (default false) so the full sidebar layout renders.

 * short-circuit to `window.api.openGlobalSettings()` before reaching
 * the overlay, so every payload that lands here has `initialTab: 'comfy'`
 * by construction. `initialDetailTab` carries the real per-install
 * landing tab (`'status' | 'update' | 'snapshots' | 'settings'`) and
 * `noSidebar` is dead (the new modal has no sidebar). Fields kept for
 * now to avoid breaking the legacy `SettingsModal` (soft-deleted but
 * still present per `feedback_soft_delete_convention`). Drop the legacy
 * fields when `SettingsModal.vue` is hard-deleted.
